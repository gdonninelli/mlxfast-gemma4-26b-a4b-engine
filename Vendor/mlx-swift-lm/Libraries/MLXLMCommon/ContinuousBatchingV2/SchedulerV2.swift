// ContinuousBatchingV2 — WS-B: unified token-budget scheduler (vLLM-V1 style).
//
// There is no "prefill phase" and no "decode phase". Each request carries a
// token list (prompt + confirmed generated tokens) and `numComputedTokens`
// (tokens fed through the model). At every step `plan()` assigns each request
// `min(remaining, budget)` new tokens so `numComputedTokens` catches up to
// the number of known tokens; decode rows naturally request exactly 1.
// (Reference: vLLM v1 scheduler.py:395-404 — see research report 08 §1.)
//
// This file is PURE, SYNCHRONOUS bookkeeping: no MLX imports, no arrays, no
// I/O. It is fully unit-testable without model weights. All methods must be
// called from a single thread (the engine thread); the engine serializes.
